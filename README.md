   ## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework. It provides a wide range of tools, libraries, and resources to develop and deploy machine learning models.

- **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. It is capable of running on top of various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow. In this code, we use the Keras API from TensorFlow to load and preprocess the image.

- **VGG16**: VGG16 is a convolutional neural network architecture that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains millions of labeled images. It is commonly used for image classification tasks. In this code, we load the pre-trained VGG16 model from the TensorFlow Keras applications module.

- **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Here, NumPy is used to perform array operations on the image data.

- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: PIL is a library in Python that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. In this code, we use the `image` module from PIL to load and preprocess the image.

## Code Summary

The code demonstrates the following steps:

1. Load the pre-trained VGG16 model using TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Load and preprocess an image using the PIL library.
3. Perform a prediction on the preprocessed image using the VGG16 model.
4. Extract the top three predicted classes and their probabilities using the `decode_predictions` function.
5. Display the predicted classes and probabilities.

This code snippet can be used as a reference for image classification tasks using the VGG16 model in TensorFlow with Python.
